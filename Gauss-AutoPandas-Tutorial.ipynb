    "# About\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauss (AutoPandas 2.0) is a programming-by-example (PbE) system for table transformations in Pandas. PbE systems generally accept plain input-output examples. Prior work for table transformations such as AutoPandas and Morpheus accept input-output tables as examples and synthesize the target program. This has two main flaws - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Providing a full-output table can be tedious, error-prone, and often defeats the purpose of synthesis, especially in the case of large tables.\n",
    "2. A lot of rich information is thrown away. For example, the type of aggregation being performed, something which is known to the user of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauss extends the input-output example modality for table transformations, by providing a rich interface to the user to construct **partial outputs** or partial tables, using an array of operators covering simple operations such as addition subtraction. Gauss transparently captures the user interaction and generalizes the partial output to synthesize better code, faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will understand the basics of the interface provided by Gauss, and how you can use it to synthesize code for table transformation tasks that are easy to understand but relatively hard to automate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feedback\n",
    "This tool is in an alpha stage therefore any feedback regarding usability or bug reports would be very welcome! Please reach out to any member of the team:\n",
