    "# About\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauss (AutoPandas 2.0) is a programming-by-example (PbE) system for table transformations in Pandas. PbE systems generally accept plain input-output examples. Prior work for table transformations such as AutoPandas and Morpheus accept input-output tables as examples and synthesize the target program. This has two main flaws - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Providing a full-output table can be tedious, error-prone, and often defeats the purpose of synthesis, especially in the case of large tables.\n",
    "2. A lot of rich information is thrown away. For example, the type of aggregation being performed, something which is known to the user of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauss extends the input-output example modality for table transformations, by providing a rich interface to the user to construct **partial outputs** or partial tables, using an array of operators covering simple operations such as addition subtraction. Gauss transparently captures the user interaction and generalizes the partial output to synthesize better code, faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will understand the basics of the interface provided by Gauss, and how you can use it to synthesize code for table transformation tasks that are easy to understand but relatively hard to automate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Cell Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single Cell** - Clicking on a cell selects it. Clicking it again will de-select it.\n",
    "* **Multiple Cells** - There are two distinct ways of selecting multiple cells:\n",
    "    - **Mouse Drag**: Click the mouse down on a cell and drag and release the mouse over another cell. A continuous 2-D range will be created between the two cells and clear any existing ranges.\n",
    "    - **⌘(Cmd) + Mouse Drag**: Holding ⌘(Cmd) key while creating a range using mouse drag will create a new range selection and keep any existing ranges. This is useful for selecting cells not adjacent to each other. It also imposes an order of selection which is useful for some binary operations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Copy-Pasting\n",
    "\n",
    "In general you can only copy and paste from the input to the output. The number of cells being pasted to should match the copied content on the clipboard. For example, the system will complain if 4 values are being pasted onto 3 cells. The following instructions assume the correct number of cells have been copied to the clipboard.\n",

    "* **Single Cell** - Select a cell in the output, and press ⌘(Cmd)-V to paste the value.\n",
    "* **Multiple Cells** - There are two distinct ways of pasting multiple cells:\n",
    "    - **Specify All Cells**: Select the right number of cells, in the desired order if necessary (by holding ⌘(Cmd) and clicking cells), and press ⌘(Cmd)-V to paste the values.\n",
    "    - **Specify Start Cell**: If a single cell is selected, the system pastes all the values starting from that cell with the shape determined as follows:\n",
    "        - If the copied content is a continuous 2-D range, the shape is retained.\n",
    "        - The cells are pasted in a single vertical column.\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Performing Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for performing operations such as aggregations, transformations, binary operations, string operations, filtering and deletion are as follows - \n",
    "* Select the target cells using the cell-selection mechanism above.\n",
    "* Press right-click to access the context menu.\n",
    "* Operations are bucketed in various categories. Select the one you want by accessing the appropriate category.\n",
    "    - Hovering over an operation will activate a tooltip describing the operation.\n",
    "* Once the operation is clicked, the result is stored into the clipboard.\n",
    "* The result(s) can be pasted into the output using the same pasting mechanism described above.\n"
